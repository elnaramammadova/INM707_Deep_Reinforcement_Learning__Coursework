"Exploring the Q-learning Algorithm in Basic and Advanced Environments" 


This coursework aims to examine and critically evaluate a battery of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques in different scenarios, each increasing in order of complexity. 
PART 1:
  Implementation of Q-learning algorithm in a custom-built environment (UBER POOL) - using two separate policies (UCB, Decayed Epsilon Greedy)
  Code -- **CW_Part1_UberPool.ipynb**
  
PART 2: 
  DQN, with Double DQN and Dueling DQN improvements in the Open AI Gym environment using a customized neural network built via PyTorch 
  Code -- **CW_Part2_Vanilla_DQN.ipynb**
       -- **CW_Part2_DoubleDQN.ipynb**
       -- **CW_Part2_DuelingDQN.ipynb**
  
  DQN Trainer for the Atari 2600 Pong game environment using the Ray RLlib library.
  Code -- **CW_Part3_AtariPong_Niter.ipynb**
